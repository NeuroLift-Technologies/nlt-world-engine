# NLT World Engine — AI Habitat & Physical Simulation Layer

> **Engine: Godot 4.7.2 (C#) is authoritative (thread `ENG-002`).** Decided by Joshua on 2026-10-07: Godot replaces UE 5.8 in its entirety as this repo's simulation runtime. The UE 5.8 tree in `WorldEngine/` is a **frozen, non-authoritative reference implementation** retained for its documented semantics — it is not the simulation and not a conformance oracle. Pinned toolchain: [`docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md`](docs/engine-reference/godot/VERSION.md).

## The Vision

**NLT World Engine is an embodied multi-agent simulation where machine learning models inhabit a persistent world, control their characters, interact with environments and other agents, and transition between meaningful life scenarios.**

**An AI habitat — a virtual world where AI agents live, perceive, act, and learn.** The world is rendered with realistic graphics: procedural terrain, water, sky, vegetation, and settlement. AI residents walk through this world with articulated bodies, animated walk cycles, and name labels. Humans watch through a spectator viewer.

NeuroLift Technologies Simulation Environment — the deterministic runtime where AI Avatars (with ADHD traits) and AI Aides live inside. This repo owns the **physical simulation layer** and is the **authoritative simulation training environment** for the Avatar-Aide-Advocate system: world state, space, time, objects, needs, NPCs, scenario instantiation, and the authoritative simulation itself. Avatar/Aide/Advocate *intelligence* — ADHD trait modeling, coaching expertise, training loop, fusion — lives in [`neurolift-ai-fusion`](https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/neurolift-ai-fusion) and connects through the agent interface.

> **Core principle:** Fusion owns semantic reality; **the world engine** owns physical reality. The engine is an implementation detail of the physical layer and may change by Joshua's decision under OTOI §4.4 — the Fusion ↔ world-engine boundary does not.
>
> **Architecture docs:** [`WorldEngine/docs/architecture/`](WorldEngine/docs/architecture/) and [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) describe the frozen UE 5.8 reference implementation for historical context. They are not the target architecture or a conformance oracle. Godot 4.7.2 replaces UE in its entirety as this repository's authoritative physical simulation runtime.

## Human Role in the Supervised Simulation

Humans are not passive observers of AI development here. They are active participants providing oversight, context, evaluation and authorization. The governing principle is **AI capability ≠ AI authority** — the ability of an AI system to perform an action does not determine whether that action should be performed.

[`docs/Human-Role-in-Supervised-Simulation.md`](docs/Human-Role-in-Supervised-Simulation.md) — `NLT-SIM-HUMAN-ROLE-1.0.0`, *Draft / Proposed Architectural Standard*, governance: Solidarity Framework | ASFDK — defines that participation model. Six human roles: **Supervisor, Observer, Evaluator, Scenario Designer, Instructor/Guide, Governance Authority**. Four interaction modes: **Observation, Supervision, Intervention, Evaluation**. Its `Scope` field reads `NLT World Engine | AI-Fusion Framework`, so it binds **both** repos.

**What this repo implements today.** Godot is the authoritative physical simulation runtime; Fusion owns semantic cognition and intents. The transport-neutral boundary is documented in [`docs/agent-loop.md`](docs/agent-loop.md). An opt-in single-avatar test scene now connects the async HTTP client, Fusion endpoint, engine-side governance, and physical ingress; production orchestration and full in-scene verification remain incomplete. Observer and supervised-simulation capabilities are also in progress; the legacy UE implementation is reference material only and does not define current runtime behavior.

**Observer audience — a standing requirement.** People with ADHD must be able to **watch and understand the simulation without needing to parse a dense analytics dashboard.** This is a design constraint, not a later pass: it governs the observation surface, its accessibility settings, and its reading levels.

> **Draft status.** This standard is *proposed*, so it does not yet bind implementation. It is mirrored in `neurolift-ai-fusion`; both copies were byte-identical when this section was written, but neither repo designates a source of truth or commits the file.

UE 5.8 (WorldEngine/) — frozen historical reference, not authoritative
```

## Physical-World Agent Loop

The `nlt.agent-loop.v1` contract defines how Fusion semantics and Godot's physical simulation work
together: the engine reports what an agent can physically perceive, Fusion returns a semantic action
intent, the engine-side ASFDK-C# governance boundary checks it, and the engine validates and
executes it physically. The engine owns physical state and consequences; Fusion owns cognition and
meaning; ASFDK supplies a cross-cutting governance boundary. This is separate from
`nlt.state-feed.v1`, which remains an observer/presentation feed.

The contract, allowed verbs, message examples, validation rules, ASFDK governance placement, and
current implementation status are described in the [agent-loop feature overview](docs/agent-loop.md)
and [protocol specification](docs/contracts/agent-loop-v1.md). The Godot async HTTP client, cadence driver, opt-in single-avatar scene composition, Fusion endpoint,
engine-side intent ingress, and governance gate are implemented. The scene path is disabled by
default; set `NLT_AGENT_LOOP_ENABLED=1` to spawn the dedicated local test avatar and visible target.
Fusion can use the local GGUF through `FUSION_GGUF_MODEL`, or its deterministic fallback when unset.
A cross-process HTTP smoke test using the fallback passed; a full in-scene model-to-world run still
needs verification on the test workstation. See [`docs/agent-loop.md`](docs/agent-loop.md) for
startup steps. The versioned contract remains transport-agnostic.

## Quick Start — Godot 4.7.2 (authoritative engine)

**Prerequisites:** Godot **4.7.2 .NET (mono)** + .NET 8 SDK.

```bash
# Open the project in Godot 4.7.2 .NET (mono)
godot --path world-engine-godot

# Build the Godot assembly, then run its out-of-engine assertion runner:
dotnet build world-engine-godot/world-engine-godot.csproj
dotnet run --project world-engine-godot/AgentHarness/AgentHarness.csproj
```

`AgentHarness` is a .NET console runner for agent-action and protocol assertions. It does not start
the Godot scene or connect to Fusion, so passing it does not demonstrate a live simulation loop.

**Status:** Godot is the authoritative physical simulation runtime. Contract DTOs, validation, and agent-control assertions exist; live Fusion transport, complete scene integration, and engine-owned interaction execution remain in progress. See [the agent-loop overview](docs/agent-loop.md).

## Historical Reference — Unreal Engine 5.8

> UE is frozen, non-authoritative reference material. It is not the active simulation or a conformance oracle. **Do not change UE simulation behavior.**

**Prerequisites:** UE 5.8 at `~/Documents/NLT/Engine/`, Linux (Clang 20.1.8)

**Primary path — rendered Unreal Editor or standalone game:**

```bash
cd WorldEngine
make configure          # Generate project files
make WorldEngineEditor  # Build editor (~85s)
```

Open `WorldEngine.uproject` in the UE Editor, select the training scenario, and run the configured training flow in Play In Editor or a rendered standalone game. The human watches the same UE world in which agents simulate and learn.

**Optional headless automation:**

```bash
~/Documents/NLT/Engine/Binaries/Linux/UnrealEditor-Cmd \
  -project=WorldEngine.uproject \
  -nullrhi -game -unattended -log \
  -MAP=/Game/Scenarios/Levels/Workplace_Level.Workplace_Level
```

The headless command is for automation, CI, or later infrastructure. It is not required for the primary training path. A future `WorldEngineServer` target is likewise optional.

## Character & Mesh — UE reference

> `SM_SimBody_Base` is a **static low-poly mesh, not a rig**, and `CHAR-001` (emotion-driven animation) was blocked on missing mesh assets. The vision calls for *"articulated bodies, animated walk cycles, and name labels"* — none of which UE delivered. The old migration plan described a glTF humanoid rig, a **procedural** walk cycle driven by velocity, and `Label3D` name labels; that plan is superseded and is not current scope.

- `BP_AvatarCharacter` — Blueprint character + SimBody skeletal mesh
- `SM_SimBody_Base` — low-poly humanoid (~179.5cm, Nanite off)
- `AAvatarAIController` — navmesh-based wandering, RL training foundation

## Spectator

The vision is *"humans watch through a spectator viewer."* The Babylon.js client is archived, and `Content/Web/` holds a 2D canvas viewer that was never wired up. Godot 4.7.2 is now the authoritative desktop simulation runtime and observer surface; its integration with live Fusion state remains in progress. Godot 4 cannot export C# to web, so any future browser client would be a separate project.

## Archived Components

Both previously lived at repository root and are now under `_archive/`. Neither was connected to the live simulation:

- **`_archive/world-engine-v2/`** — Babylon.js viewer. Note its logic layer contains **no `fetch`, no `WebSocket`, no `XMLHttpRequest`**: `simulation.ts` is a pure client-side timer and `data.ts` hardcodes all world data. Reviving it as a spectator would mean rewriting its logic layer from scratch.
- **`_archive/world-engine/`** — Python ECS engine, a reference implementation. Retained for data pipeline use and as the origin of the `AgentController` / `AgentInterface` seams the current design inherits.

## CI

| Workflow | Triggers | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `validate-governance.yml` | push/PR to any branch | Governance validation |
| Godot project build | Local .NET/Godot SDK | Builds the authoritative Godot application; no product build workflow is currently configured |

**No workflow currently builds product code.** `world-engine-v2-build.yml` was removed because it filtered on `world-engine-v2/**`, which moved to `_archive/`. Godot build and harness commands are documented in the [quick start](#quick-start--godot-472-authoritative-engine).

## Historical UE 5.8 Work Log

> The following backlog describes the retired UE 5.8 implementation only. It is preserved for historical context and is **not** the current Godot implementation plan or a conformance checklist. Current work is tracked in [`docs/active-threads.md`](docs/active-threads.md).

### Product and runtime implementation

- **Native Mass StateTree runtime integration:** The current behavior path is a deterministic custom C++ Mass processor plus StateTree task/condition references. Native `UMassStateTreeProcessor` execution and authored `.sttree` behavior assets remain follow-up work.
- **Fusion ↔ Unreal WebSocket protocol:** The UE WebSocket listener now validates versioned envelopes, requires action type/target, rejects malformed JSON, and dispatches authoritative work on the game thread. End-to-end Python↔UE conformance, session/agent correlation, authorization, acknowledgements, and duplicate/timeout handling remain unverified.
- **Replay action execution:** Define approved action semantics and execute recorded actions against the authoritative simulation. Compare intermediate state/event hashes and the final state/RNG state across a multi-tick replay. The current replay implementation verifies record integrity and observed final state but does not execute action payloads.
- **Rendered LOD transition validation:** Validate Mass and actor-resident transitions in a representative rendered UE scene, including hysteresis, viewer fallback, mesh/HISM/fallback representation changes, and hidden transitions. The shared visual-only policy and integration are implemented; live-scene evidence is still pending.
- **Broader UE Automation coverage:** Add integration tests for native StateTree behavior, WebSocket protocol handling, replay action execution, rendered LOD transitions, and headless guards. The existing `AutomationTest` suite passes 7/7 `NLT.Simulation` and 4/4 `NLT.VisualLOD.Policy` tests; the Python Fusion reference suite passes 9 tests but does not prove UE interoperability.

### Validation and CI

- **UE build validation in CI:** Select a UE-capable runner, add `WorldEngineEditor` build validation, run the NLT Automation suites, and publish logs/test reports. **Current CI validates governance only** — no workflow builds or tests product code.
- **Optional headless infrastructure:** Validate `WorldEngineServer` and headless runtime behavior on a UE distribution that supports Server targets. Optional later infrastructure, not a prerequisite for the training path.
- **Three vision claims are unmet in UE and unaddressed by the migration:** agent↔agent interaction, an NPC population (no NPC system exists at all — UE's "residents" are `AAvatarCharacter`), and realistic graphics. Each needs its own thread rather than being silently inherited.

### Completed foundations

- Versioned deterministic state hashing and RNG reset/serialization metadata.
- Versioned JSON replay records with integrity, tamper, serialization, and observed-final-state checks.
- Shared visual-only LOD policy for Mass HISM and actor residents, with 4/4 policy tests passing.
- Deterministic C++ Mass behavior processor, StateTree schema/task/condition references, and an expanded Python Fusion protocol/replay reference.
- Dedicated Server target/configuration and headless runtime guards are present, but the optional Server target has not been compiled on a server-capable UE distribution.
