```

A Sims/RPG-style simulation environment where AI Avatars with ADHD traits experience authentic life struggles while AI Aides provide real-time coaching. After sufficient training through repeated scenarios, they fuse into Advocates that combine lived understanding with expert solutions.

🎯 Project Vision
Mission: "Nothing About Us Without Us" - neurodivergent voices lead development

This project implements experiential learning for AI systems, not traditional data training. Avatars don't just analyze patterns about ADHD - they actually live through the struggles, experience real stress, make mistakes, and learn through doing with Aide support.

Core Innovation
Nobody else is training AI this way. While the industry has solved infrastructure (MCP, A2A protocols), two critical gaps remain:

User preference enforcement: UNSOLVED ← OTOI addresses this
AI capability reliability: UNSOLVED (38.1% computer use accuracy, 85% agentic AI failure rate)
This simulation approach addresses both gaps through authentic experiential learning.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
The Avatar-Aide-Advocate Process
Phase 1: Avatar Creation
Each Avatar embodies a specific ADHD trait/executive function deficit
Experiences authentic stress, frustration, and failure patterns
Lives through simulated everyday scenarios where their specific trait creates challenges
Makes real mistakes with real consequences in the virtual environment
Phase 2: Aide Development
Foundation Components:

RRT (Rapid Response Team) Core - Pre-existing therapeutic knowledge with dormant burnout response
PhD-Level Expertise - Deep academic research on specific executive functions
Real-World Feedback - Input from people with ADHD who've mastered that specific area
Role: Coach, therapist, and assistant operating IN the simulation environment alongside the Avatar

Phase 3: Simulation Training
Environment: Sims/RPG-style virtual world with realistic consequences

Scenario Categories:

Workplace: HR compliance, meetings, project management, performance reviews
Personal: Household management, social relationships, financial tasks, self-care
Social Dynamics: Rejection sensitivity, emotional regulation, social cues
Key Environmental Features:

Neurotypical NPCs: Complete same tasks easily, creating realistic social comparison
Biased NPCs: Exhibit workplace discrimination, microaggressions, ableism
Random Dysfunction Injection: Suddenly adds new executive function challenges
Real Consequences: Failed tasks have meaningful impact, creating authentic learning pressure
Phase 4: Fusion into Advocate
When: After Avatar demonstrates consistent independence across scenarios
How: Combine Avatar's experiential struggle awareness with Aide's proven expertise
Result: An Advocate that both understands what ADHD struggles feel like AND knows what actually works

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+
Git
Installation
# Clone the repository


git clone <repository-url>
cd neurolift-ai-fusion

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run initial setup
python scripts/setup_environment.py
Running Your First Training Session
Use this verified sequence to confirm your local setup before deeper development:

# 1) Syntax smoke check for core modules and scripts
python3 -m compileall src scripts

# 2) Run the interactive training loop demo
python3 scripts/test_training_loop.py
test_training_loop.py currently reaches scenario execution, then fails during coaching context construction (see troubleshooting below). This is useful for validating the setup path and reproducing current integration behavior.

🔁 CI and Repository Automation Workflows (GitHub Actions)
Intent and architecture
This repository currently has three automation workflows in .github/workflows/:

Workflow file	Actions UI name	Role	Job flow
.github/workflows/shared-ci.yml	Shared CI	Organization-standard checks via reusable workflows in NeuroLift-Technologies/nlt-fusion	lint -> (test, security)
.github/workflows/python-app.yml	Python application	Local baseline checks defined in this repository	single build job (checkout -> setup python -> install -> flake8 -> pytest)
.github/workflows/pr-cleanup.yml	PR Cleanup	Repository hygiene: marks stale PRs, auto-closes stale PRs, and deletes merged source branches	stale-prs + delete-merged-branches
Both CI workflows currently use Python 3.10.

Trigger behavior and constraints
shared-ci.yml and python-app.yml run on:

push to master
pull_request targeting master
workflow_dispatch (manual run from the Actions tab)
pr-cleanup.yml runs on:

a daily schedule (cron: 0 6 * * *, 06:00 UTC)
workflow_dispatch with optional inputs:
days_before_stale (default 30)
days_before_close (default 7)
Important constraints:

A push to a non-master branch does not auto-run CI unless you open a PR to master or trigger manually.
Because both CI workflows subscribe to the same events, a PR to master runs both pipelines.
PR cleanup staleness currently uses defaults of 30 inactive days before stale, then 7 more days before auto-close (overridable via manual dispatch inputs).
Draft PRs are explicitly exempt from staleness in pr-cleanup.yml (exempt-draft-pr: true).
PR cleanup only targets pull requests (issue staleness is disabled via days-before-issue-stale: -1 and days-before-issue-close: -1).
Branch deletion only applies to branches merged from this repository (not forks), and skips protected/default branches.
Agent automation definitions (.github/agents/*.agent.md)
This repository also includes agent prompt definitions under .github/agents/:

Agent file	Purpose	Current status
.github/agents/pr-cleanup.agent.md	Prompt/spec for PR cleanup reporting behavior (stale PR + merged branch hygiene context)	Active prompt asset
.github/agents/my-agent.agent.md	Generic starter template for defining additional custom agents	Template only
Important constraint:

No workflow in .github/workflows/ currently imports or executes .agent.md files directly. Runtime automation behavior is defined by workflow YAML (plus external automation tooling), while .agent.md files define prompt/behavior expectations.
PR Cleanup runbook (.github/workflows/pr-cleanup.yml)
Subsystems covered:

Stale PR lifecycle (actions/stale@v9)
Marks inactive PRs with stale after configured inactivity.
Closes stale PRs after configured grace period with auto-closed label.
Exempts draft PRs (exempt-draft-pr: true).
Merged branch deletion (actions/github-script@v7)
Scans closed PRs and keeps only merged PRs from this repository (not forks).
Skips protected/default branches (master, main, develop, dev, release) and any branch returned by repos.listBranches(protected: true).
Deletes refs/heads/<branch> and treats HTTP 422 as "already deleted."
Codepath map (source-verified):

Behavior	Workflow codepath	Notes
Stale threshold input	github.event.inputs.days_before_stale || 30	Manual dispatch can override default 30.
Close threshold input	github.event.inputs.days_before_close || 7	Manual dispatch can override default 7.
PR-only scope	days-before-issue-stale: -1, days-before-issue-close: -1	Issues are explicitly excluded.
Merged PR branch filter	pr.merged_at !== null + pr.head.repo.full_name === <current repo>	Excludes fork-origin branches.
Protected branch skip	static set + repos.listBranches(protected: true)	Includes both default names and API-protected branches.
Branch deletion API call	github.rest.git.deleteRef({ ref: "heads/<branch>" })	HTTP 422 is logged as already deleted and not fatal.
Operational constraints and pitfalls:

Branch deletion requires contents: write; stale/close operations require pull-requests: write and issues: write.
The merged-branch cleanup loop reads up to per_page: 100 closed PRs per run.
Fork-origin PR branches are not deleted by design.
Schedule times are UTC; if cleanup appears "late", verify timezone conversion before changing cron.
Manual usage
From GitHub UI:

Open Actions.
Select Shared CI, Python application, or PR Cleanup.
Click Run workflow.
Choose the branch and (for PR Cleanup) optionally override stale/close thresholds.
For manual PR cleanup tuning (PR Cleanup only):

Open Actions -> PR Cleanup -> Run workflow.
Set days_before_stale (default 30) and days_before_close (default 7) if needed.
Run and inspect logs for the stale-prs and delete-merged-branches jobs.
PR cleanup verification checklist:

Confirm the run used the expected days_before_stale and days_before_close values.
In stale-prs logs, verify labels/actions align with the current policy (stale, auto-closed, draft PR exemption).
In delete-merged-branches logs, verify each skip/delete outcome is expected (fork PR, protected branch, or already deleted branch).
If merged branches remain, check whether the relevant PRs fall outside the current per_page: 100 query window.
To reproduce python-app.yml locally:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install flake8 pytest
if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics
pytest
Maintenance checklist
Update Python version in both CI workflows together to avoid drift:
.github/workflows/shared-ci.yml -> with.python-version
.github/workflows/python-app.yml -> with.python-version
Keep branch trigger filters aligned in both CI files when changing branch policy.
Treat shared-ci.yml behavior as externally defined: it calls reusable workflows from nlt-fusion at @main.
Do not remove security-events: write from shared-ci.yml unless the reusable security workflow no longer needs upload permissions.
When changing PR retention policy, update both code and docs together:
.github/workflows/pr-cleanup.yml (days-before-stale, days-before-close)
this README section (trigger behavior + runbook defaults)
Protect long-lived branches in GitHub settings so delete-merged-branches can safely skip them using the protected-branch API check.
Do not reduce PR Cleanup write permissions unless stale labeling/closing and branch deletion behavior is intentionally being disabled.
Keep cleanup intent aligned in two places when requirements change:
.github/workflows/pr-cleanup.yml (enforced behavior)
.github/agents/pr-cleanup.agent.md (agent runbook + reporting expectations)
Troubleshooting and common pitfalls
CI did not run: confirm the event targets master, or run with workflow_dispatch.
Shared CI fails before local tests run: inspect reusable workflow logs from nlt-fusion; failures there can occur without changes in this repository.
Security/test ordering confusion: in shared-ci.yml, both test and security depend on lint and can run in parallel after lint passes.
python-app.yml lint behavior seems inconsistent: the first flake8 command fails on syntax/name errors; the second uses --exit-zero and is informational for style/complexity reporting.
PR branch was not deleted after merge: check whether the PR came from a fork, whether the branch is protected, or whether it was already deleted (422 is treated as non-fatal in workflow logs).
PR expected to stay open got marked stale: add any activity (comment/commit/review) or convert to draft if it is actively in progress but intentionally paused.
Local runtime troubleshooting (scripts)
ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package from scripts/run_training_session.py: run_training_session.py imports avatars.* after modifying sys.path, but modules under src/avatars use package-relative imports (..core), so direct execution currently fails.
TypeError: CoachingContext.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'avatar' from scripts/test_training_loop.py: this script still uses an older CoachingContext call pattern that no longer matches src/aides/base_aide.py.
Need a deterministic smoke path while those scripts are being reconciled: run python3 -m compileall src scripts, then use tests/test_simulation/test_session_orchestrator.py as the reference for current orchestration interfaces.
