# NeuroLift World Engine — Completion Plan

> **Vision:** A real-time simulation where pairs of ML Models (Avatar + Aide) train through authentic ADHD experiences in a Sims-like world, fusing into empathetic Advocates. Designed for human observation — looks, feels, and storytelling matter as much as the training itself.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Observable first** — Every action should be visible and understandable to a spectator
2. **Emotional resonance** — Viewers should feel the Avatar's struggle and celebrate their wins
3. **Trait authenticity** — Each ADHD trait should manifest in distinct, recognizable behavior
4. **Coaching visibility** — Aide interventions should be clear, timely, and satisfying
5. **Fusion as climax** — The moment of fusion should feel earned and spectacular
6. **Data integrity** — The simulation should produce meaningful training data
7. **Performance** — Must run smoothly with 19+ pairs simultaneously
