### 3.3 Migration Decision

| sim.jsx tick loop | Ported → `UNLTSimulationSubsystem` C++ |
| data.js (avatars, scenarios, rooms) | Ported → UE Data Assets / Data Tables + `UScenarioDataAsset` |
| WebSocket live mode | Keep — Unreal connects via `NLTWebServerSubsystem` |
| world-view.jsx | Keep for web; Unreal replaces 3D rendering |
| Python engine | Remains separate; Fusion Runtime bridges via event bus |

## 4. Architectural Conflicts & Risks

### 4.1 Critical: Mass Entity Is the Population Foundation

**Risk:** UE 5.8 Mass Entity + StateTree are not yet production-proven at massive scale. Epic's own demos show ~10k entities comfortably; 50k requires careful LOD management.

**Mitigation:** Follow the handoff's LOD strategy rigorously:
- LOD 0: Full Actor (500 near player)
- LOD 1: Reduced representation (5k nearby)
- LOD 2: Mass simulation (20k regional)
- LOD 3: Abstract simulation (24.5k remote, no physical rep)

### 4.2 Critical: No Actor-Centric Architecture

**Risk:** UE tutorials and most community code assume ACharacter-based AI. Every standard AI Controller, Behavior Tree, and PawnSensing component assumes an Actor exists.

**Mitigation:**
- Use MassEntity as the simulation layer
- Use StateTree for behavior execution (not cognitive intelligence)
- Actors only for LOD 0 embodied agents
- Smart Objects for world affordances

### 4.3 Important: LLM/Model Coupling

**Risk:** Directly calling LLM APIs from the simulation tick will destroy performance and create non-determinism.

**Mitigation:**
- Cognition Gateway interface (`ICognitionProvider`)
- Async cognition — requests don't block ticks
- Deterministic mock provider for testing

### 4.4 Important: Determinism vs Unreal

**Risk:** Unreal's physics, garbage collection, and rendering are inherently non-deterministic. Promising perfect determinism is a trap.

**Mitigation:**
- Use seeded RNG for simulation decisions (`NLTDeterministicSeedSubsystem`)
- Track `RandomSeed + SimulationTick + EventSequence` for reproducibility
- Accept approximate determinism (same seed → same decisions, not same frame times)

### 4.5 Moderate: Linux Build Toolchain

**Risk:** Linux UE development is less documented than Windows. Some plugins (MetaHuman, some ML tools) have limited Linux support.

**Mitigation:** The existing WorldEngine project already builds on Linux (Clang 20.1.8, UBA). We're greenfield — no Windows-specific code needed.

## 6. Unresolved Questions

| # | Question | Impact | Recommended Resolution |
|---|----------|--------|----------------------|
| 1 | Should the existing Cloudflare DO remain authoritative, or does Unreal take over simulation? | Architectural fork | DO remains source of truth; Unreal is a high-fidelity visualization + optional simulation node |
| 2 | How many agents must the system actually support? | Scale design | Start with 1k, profile, scale to 10k, defer 50k |
| 3 | Is real-time (30Hz+) simulation required, or is tick-based (1-10Hz) sufficient? | Architecture complexity | Tick-based (1-10Hz) with interpolation for rendering |
| 4 | What is the budget for cloud compute (if headless servers are used)? | Headless architecture | Not yet constrained; profile on consumer hardware first |
| 5 | How does the existing Python engine stub relate to the Unreal implementation? | Duplicate effort | Python remains offline/training; Unreal is runtime. Bridge via event bus |
| 6 | Is there a specific gamefeel/visual quality bar for LOD 0 agents? | Art pipeline | Start with primitive shapes; MetaHuman only for final demo |
| 7 | Should `NLTGovernanceSubsystem` be implemented now or deferred? | Governance compliance | Defer — ASFDK integration pending governance review |

---

## 7. Recommended First Steps

1. **Complete NLTGovernanceSubsystem** — TOI/OTOI/ASFDK boundary (currently planned, not implemented)
2. **Implement StateTree behavior trees** — cognitive intelligence layer on top of Mass
3. **Build semantic world** — one room, Smart Object, navigation (levels exist, need connectivity)
4. **Connect to Fusion** — deterministic mock cognition, real event flow
5. **Profile Mass Entity at scale** — prove LOD strategy with 1-10 agents first

---

## 8. Conclusion

The handoff architecture is **sound and largely validated**. The key insight — Fusion owns semantic reality, Unreal owns physical reality — is correct and the implementation reflects it rigorously.

The existing WorldEngine UE project has evolved from an empty shell into a fully populated C++ module with 11 subsystems, Mass Entity integration, training infrastructure, and web server control. The toolchain works. The prior attempts (MyProject, MyProject2) have been removed.

The fusion repo (neurolift-ai-fusion) has correspondingly matured — Python engine is no longer stubs, with active Avatar/Aide/Advocate/EventBus implementations and a full scenario system.

**The riskiest element remains Mass Entity + StateTree at scale.** We should prove the architecture with 1-10 agents first, then scale aggressively with profiling at every step.

The deliverables from the original handoff are achievable in this order:
1. Architecture Assessment ← (this document, validated)
2. Unreal Architecture ← (in progress — C++ skeleton complete)
3. Domain Mapping ← (mostly mapped — see Section 3.1 status column)
4. Initial Technical Prototype ← (Milestones 1-3)
5. Build Documentation ← (alongside)
