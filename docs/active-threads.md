### 🔧 BUILD-WIN64-001 — Win64 build repair: ASFDK wiring + hot-reload state
- **Status:** resolved
- **Owner:** Cline
- **Started:** 2026-09-21
- **Last updated:** 2026-09-24
- **Branch:** `fix/win64-asfdk-stubs` · **PR:** [#50](https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/nlt-world-engine/pull/50)
- **Blockers:** None for the Win64 editor build. Two decisions remain with Joshua: (1) build a
  real Win64 ASFDK library — the Win64 stubs remain the verified interim; (2) the
  C:-build-tree ↔ canonical-repo sync story. Linux builds are additionally blocked until
  `libasfdk.a` exists in the ASFDK checkout; the module now fails with repair guidance at
  rule-evaluation time instead of a bare linker error.
- **Summary:** User's Visual Studio `WorldEngineEditor Win64 Development` build failed with C1083
  (`asfdk/ASFDK.h`), LNK1104 (`UnrealEditor-WorldEngine-0002.lib.rsp` missing), and MSB3073.
  Root causes: (1) the `ThirdParty/ASFDK` junction in the C: UE build tree pointed at the
  pre-move `C:\...\nlt-repos\asfdk-cplus` location (nlt-repos now on D:); (2) legacy
  hot-reload-from-IDE re-applying a stale, inconsistent `HotReloadState.json` while
  `UnrealEditor.exe` was running. The canonical repo additionally had a dangling gitlink
  (no `.gitmodules` mapping) for the ASFDK submodule.
- **Delivered (verified):** hardened `NLTGovernanceSubsystem.Build.cs` (ASFDK_ROOT override +
  loud BuildException, duplicate-nlohmann guard, and a fatal guard when `libasfdk.a` is
  absent on Linux); `ASFDK_Win64Stubs.cpp` rewritten and proven
  compile/link-clean against the real headers (standalone MSVC probe + full UBT builds);
  `.gitmodules` added and submodule restored at pinned `55b21fe`; forensic write-up at
  `WorldEngine/docs/building/LNK1104-rsp-diagnosis.md`. Both `WorldEngine` and
  `WorldEngineEditor` targets build `Result: Succeeded` in the C: build tree.
- **Handoff:** `docs/agent-log/handoffs/2026-09-21-cline-win64-asfdk-build-repair.json`
- **Next action:** PR [#50](https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/nlt-world-engine/pull/50)
  is open with all 8 CodeRabbit review comments addressed (2026-09-24). Awaiting Joshua's
  decisions on a real Win64 ASFDK library build and on the C:-build-tree ↔ canonical-repo
  sync story.

### 🏙️ ESC-001 — UE Open-World Expansion (Fab Modern City assets as outdoor layer)
- **Agent:** OpenCode (Poolside) · **Opened:** 2026-09-20 · **Branch:** `main` (uncommitted)
- **Scope:** Port `openworld-engine` outdoor rendering into UE WorldEngine — buildings as level
  portals to indoor `.umap` scenarios, upgraded building/ground geometry with AI-usable Fab
  `Modern_City_Environment` assets, procedural determinism (seed → world) preserved.
- **Delivered (verified in standalone `-game`, seed 42):**
  - Geometry-only GLB splits imported per mesh (12 portals, **9 city-grid pieces**; 6 original + 3 new: Building_Base plaza, Building_13 podium, Grass cover); merged block aligns all pieces via the shared Fab scene origin.
  - `NLTBuildingPortalActor`: `SceneRoot` added; `UpdateBuildingMesh()` assigns Fab meshes per type with bounds-aware scaling, base-on-spawn anchoring, roof labels, footprint-sized interaction volumes. Cube fallback retained (Hut / load failure).
  - `NLTOpenWorldSubsystem`: `SpawnCityScenery()` + `bPlaceCityScenery` + `ClearOpenWorld` cleanup. Log: `City scenery: placed 9 Fab Modern City grid pieces (scale 0.770, base Z 0, world 20000x20000)`, `Open world generation complete: 12 buildings, 12 residents`; portal overlap → level streaming verified live.
  - **Baked Blender block positions (2026-09-20):** `FNLTOpenWorldConfig.BuildingLayout` (BP-editable list of type + exact location + yaw) now baked from the Fab block in Blender — Building 11 tower center (52.2, -21.7) m → Office at (4020, -1671) cm; Building 12 tower center (118.1, -65.7) m → Apartment at (9094, -5059) cm; shared scenery scale 0.770 (WorldHalf 10000 / max piece half-extent 12985). Default 12 authored buildings spread across enlarged **200×200 m** world, pre-verified footprint-clear (min center distance 2600 cm, min clearance 400 cm — logged at spawn). World size default 5000 → 20000. School + Office always spawn now. Shared `GetTargetHalfExtent()`/`GetFootprintRadius()` tables on the portal actor.
  - **Vegetation HISM upgraded:** `SM_Mobile_Trees` mesh wired (Fab "Mobile Trees" pack); per-instance scale normalized to native mesh bounds (native ~24 m → target 3-6 m) with base-on-terrain anchoring (corrects pivot offset).
  - **Hut mesh wired:** merged WoodenHouse kitbash (Blender temp scene, 391 parts → 436 K verts, 17.2×13.7×6.4 m cottage) imported as `/Game/City/Huts/DoorWoodenHouse/WoodenHouse/StaticMeshes/WoodenHouse.WoodenHouse` — fallback to cube if load fails.
- **Escalation record:** `docs/escalations/2026-09-20-openworld-expansion.md` (Progress Update section).
- **Blocker for PIE:** MCP `control_editor.play` catalog bug (rejects `control` param; console `PIE.Start` blocked as dangerous) — verification done via standalone `-game` instead.
- **Known issues (asset paths, not code):** Path_And_Imperfections and Traffic_Lights GLB imports created assets with different naming conventions (multi-mesh GLBs); WoodenHouse merged GLB re-import asset path needs verification — both are asset registry issues, not code.
- **Next action:** commit; optional follow-ups: vegetation-HISM `ensure` cleanup, NavMesh for imported meshes, texture pass on NLT_Gray geometry.
### 🚪 ENV-002 — Relocate Personal_Level Teleporter Doors (UE WorldEngine)
- **Agent:** OpenCode · **Opened:** 2026-09-20 · **Branch:** `feat/personal-level-door-relocation`
- **Scope:** The three runtime-spawned `NLTDoorActor` teleporters in `Personal_Level` were hidden in PIE — the Academic door sat behind the kitchen cabinet/stove line and the Social door behind the `Corridor_Wall_E4` corner, both hard to see/reach.
- **Delivered:** `SpawnLevelDoors()` in `NLTDemoGameMode.cpp` now spawns the doors as a visible row along the open south wall (Y=-885), clear of `Front_Door` and player starts, with yaw 180 so labels face north into the room. `Social_Level`/`Academic_Level` spawn behavior unchanged.
- **Blocker note:** Doors are code-spawned (not map actors), so the change requires a module rebuild + PIE restart to take effect; `set_transform` is edit-mode-only and cannot move PIE actors.
- **Next action:** Review PR; rebuild module, run PIE, verify door visibility/labels.

### 📄 DOC-MCP-001 — Unreal MCP Integration Documentation
- **Agent:** OpenCode · **Opened:** 2026-09-19 · **Branch:** `main`
- **Scope:** Register the unreal-mcp server config and document the WorldEngine integration. Global OpenCode MCP registration (`http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp`, ✓ connected).
- **Delivered:** `unreal-mcp` entry + governance note added to `mcp-config.yaml`; `docs/world-engine/UNREAL-MCP-INTEGRATION.md` created.
- **Blockers:** `McpAutomationBridge` plugin not yet installed in `WorldEngine/Plugins/` — its native MCP port must be set to **8001** to match.
- **Next action:** Install plugin into WorldEngine (copy or external plugin dir), set native MCP port to 8001, enable Native MCP, restart editor.

### 🎯 CHAR-001 — Character Animation & Emotion System (UE WorldEngine)
- **Agent:** Claude Code (Poolside) · **Opened:** 2026-09-13 · **Branch:** `feat/character-animation-emotion-system`
- **Scope:** Build emotion-driven character animation system in the UE WorldEngine project. Swap static-mesh SimBody characters for rigged SkeletalMesh characters with an emotion state machine wired to cognitive values (focus/stress/cogLoad/burnout), an animation state machine with smooth transitions, Avatar↔Aide social choreography, and a procedural animation fallback via UAnimInstance.
- **Delivered:** NLTEmotionStateComponent (emotion state machine), UNLTAvatarAnimInstance (procedural pose data provider + facial morph targets), NLTCharacterAnimationComponent (animation state machine with montage + static-mesh fallback), NLTPairChoreographyComponent (Avatar↔Aide social choreography), AvatarCharacter integration (emotion→animation→visuals pipeline).
- **Blockers:** No UE editor runtime available; limited to UBT headless compilation. No SkeletalMesh or AnimAssest assets exist yet — procedural UAnimInstance fallback required.
- **Next action:** Update PLAN.md with emotion-animation phase documentation. Create NLTAideCharacter class. Wire OnSimulationTick delegate for sim-synchronized cognitive decay.

### 📄 ESC-001 — Procedural Open-World Layer (Path B)
- **Agent:** OpenCode · **Opened:** 2026-09-20 · **Status:** In development (Phase 1 complete)
- **Scope:** Outdoor open-world layer where buildings are level portals to existing indoor `.umap` scenario levels (Workplace, Personal, Social, Academic). Procedural approach — ported from Three.js `openworld-engine/src/world/` into UE5 C++.
- **Escalation:** `docs/escalations/2026-09-20-openworld-expansion.md` — ✅ RESOLVED 2026-09-20 by Joshua (Fab assets inaccessible → procedural approach approved).
- **Delivered:** `NLTNoiseLibrary` (mulberry32 + Noise2D + Fbm2D ported from `noise.js`); `NLTAtmosphereSubsystem` enhanced with procedural cloud/star noise + HDRI cubemap support; `PostProcessVolumeActor` LUT support with procedural fallback; Water plugin enabled in `.uproject` + `Build.cs`; Content directory structure created; docs at `WorldEngine/docs/procedural-openworld.md`. Phase 2 (terrain) started by Pool: `ETerrainBiome` enum + `GenerateTerrainHeight`/`ClassifyTerrainBiome` added to `NLTNoiseLibrary`; faithful port of `terrain.js` createHeightField/baseHeight + biome bands; UBT incremental build (UE5.8) — 0 errors in all touched TUs.
- **Next action:** Port `terrain.js` heightfield to PCG/Landscape — IN PROGRESS (C++ heightfield port done & compiles clean; Landscape mesh instantiation deferred — requires UE editor runtime not available on this box). Building-to-level portal streaming bridge — deferred Phase 3 (cross-lane: requires Codex + Poolside coordination per escalation; NOT started by this agent). See `ENV-TEX-001` below for details.

### 🌋 ENV-TEX-001 — Procedural Terrain Heightfield Port (ESC-001 Phase 2)
- **Agent:** Pool (Poolside) · **Opened:** 2026-09-20 · **Branch:** `fix/win64-asfdk-stubs`
- **Scope:** Port `openworld-engine/src/world/terrain.js` heightfield (`createHeightField`/`baseHeight`) + biome classification (`buildTerrain` bands) into WorldEngine C++, additive on `NLTNoiseLibrary`, deterministic, NO Landscape mesh (headless).
- **Delivered:** `ETerrainBiome` enum; `UNLTNoiseLibrary::GenerateTerrainHeight` (continental island falloff + layered hill/mountain fBm — faithful port of `baseHeight` using `NLTNoiseLibrary::Fbm2D`); `UNLTNoiseLibrary::ClassifyTerrainBiome` (sand/grass/rock/snow bands adapted from `buildTerrain`). Files: `Source/WorldEngine/Public/Core/NLTNoiseLibrary.h`, `Source/WorldEngine/Private/Core/NLTNoiseLibrary.cpp`. **UBT incremental build (UE5.8, `WorldEngine Win64 Development`) — 0 errors / 0 warnings** in all touched TUs (`NLTNoiseLibrary.cpp`; `NLTAtmosphereSubsystem.cpp` recompiled against the changed header). Build overall fails ONLY on pre-existing Phase-3 `NLTBuildingPortalActor.cpp` (`StreamingHandle`) / `NLTOpenWorldSubsystem.cpp` (`GetBuildingTypeFromFName`) — not touched by this agent.
- **Blockers:** No UE editor runtime (headless UBT only) — cannot create Landscape heightmap `.umap`/PCG assets or visually verify terrain. Phase 3 portal-streaming bridge is cross-lane and explicitly out of scope for this agent.
- **Next action:** (Next session, with UE editor access) Wire `GenerateTerrainHeight` into `NLTWorldGeneratorSubsystem` → UE5 Landscape (or PCG heightfield node) → blend materials by `ClassifyTerrainBiome`. Refactor note: `NLTNoiseLibrary`'s static `Perm[512]` + `bPermInitialized`/`CurrentPermSeed` is a latent thread-safety risk if terrain and atmosphere call concurrently (see handoff).

### 🎯 Next: Integration & Testing

- **Agent:** — · **Opened:** — · **Branch:** `main`
- **Scope:** Wire together the now-merged subsystems into a coherent end-to-end flow: LLM-driven avatar → web server → Mass Entity sim → training loop.
- **Delivered:** —
- **Next baton:** 
  1. Restart editor/headless sim to pick up HTTP status-code fix (`509dc0c`)
  2. Run `python3 llm_avatar_agent.py --task "..."` against local or hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  3. Verify ASFDK governance plugin loads correctly in editor
  4. Test Learning Agents PPO training pipeline with Avatar/Aide pairs

## Resolved Threads (2026-09)

### Thread: TRAIN-001
**Status:** resolved
**Owner:** Codex (2026-09-13 session)
**Started:** 2026-09-13
**Last updated:** 2026-09-13
**Summary:** PPO training in `run_nlt_training.sh` failing with `RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (3) must match the size of tensor b (4)` at `ppo.py:99` in `Denormalize.forward`. Root cause: `ppo.py` line 71 had hardcoded `self.act_enc_num = 3`, overriding the schema-derived value of 10 (Interaction=4 + MoveDirection=6). Removed the override so `act_enc_num` correctly reads 10 from `action_schema['EncodedSize']`. Verified end-to-end: first training iteration completed successfully with PPO train profile (5501ms), Iter: 0 stats logged, networks sent/received.
**Blockers:** None — Python crash resolved. Secondary C++ restart issue identified (see TRAIN-002).
**Next action:** Recompile C++ and re-run training to verify the secondary fix (TRAIN-002).

### Thread: TRAIN-002
**Status:** open
**Owner:** Codex (pending verification)
**Started:** 2026-09-13
**Last updated:** 2026-09-13
**Summary:** After the PPO tensor fix, the first training iteration completes successfully but UE's `NLTTrainingManager::Tick()` calls `Trainer->RunTraining()` every 0.1s with `NumberOfIterations=1`. After the first iteration, the Python subprocess exits cleanly ("Done!"). On the next Tick, UE attempts to start a new training session (NLTTraining7/Configs) but the Python process is gone, producing "Error sending policy to trainer: Unexpected communication received" and repeated "Training has failed" spam.
**Fix applied:** Added `bTrainingCompleted` flag to `ANLTTrainingManager`. First Tick with `bTrain=true` (one training step); subsequent Ticks use `bTrain=false` (inference only, no Python communication). Also added `ResetAgentEpisode_Implementation` override to `UNLTTrainingEnvironment` to resolve the "ResetAgentEpisode function must be overridden!" error.
**Blockers:** Cannot recompile/verify on this machine — no UE build environment available. Requires recompilation and re-run of `run_nlt_training.sh`.
**Next action:** Recompile project and re-run training to verify both fixes work end-to-end.
